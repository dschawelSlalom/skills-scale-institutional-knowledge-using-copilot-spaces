# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

> **See also:** [OctoAcme Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed role descriptions and collaboration guidance.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Cross-Role Collaboration During Planning
- **Product Manager**: Presents vision, prioritizes backlog, defines acceptance criteria
- **Business Analyst**: Gathers and documents detailed requirements, creates user stories
- **UX Designer**: Presents design direction, user flows, and early prototypes
- **Technical Lead**: Assesses technical feasibility, identifies architecture needs and risks
- **DevOps Specialist**: Reviews infrastructure needs, deployment approach, and CI/CD requirements
- **Scrum Master** (Agile teams): Facilitates sprint planning, ensures estimation is collaborative
- **Project Manager**: Coordinates planning activities, captures dependencies and risks
- **Developers**: Provide effort estimates, raise technical concerns, clarify requirements
