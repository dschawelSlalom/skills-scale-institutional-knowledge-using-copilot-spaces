# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

> **See also:** [OctoAcme Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed role descriptions and collaboration guidance.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- **Facilitated by**: [Scrum Master](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#scrum-master) (Agile teams) or [Project Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#project-managers)
- **Attendees**: Full delivery team ([Developers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#developers), [Technical Lead](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#technical-lead), [UX Designer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#ux-designer), [DevOps Specialist](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#devops-specialist), [Business Analyst](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#business-analyst), [Product Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#product-managers))

## Cross-Role Input for Retrospectives
- **Developers**: Feedback on technical blockers, code quality, tooling
- **Technical Lead**: Insights on architecture decisions, technical debt
- **UX Designer**: Feedback on design collaboration, user feedback integration
- **DevOps Specialist**: Insights on deployment processes, infrastructure reliability
- **Business Analyst**: Observations on requirements clarity and stakeholder communication
- **Product Manager**: Product direction feedback, prioritization effectiveness
- **Scrum Master/Project Manager**: Process improvements, team dynamics, velocity trends

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- **Accountability**: Action item owners (can be any role) commit to delivery dates
- **Follow-up**: [Scrum Master](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#scrum-master) or [Project Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#project-managers) tracks progress and follows up in next retrospective
