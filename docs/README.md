- Provide AI-assisted guidance aligned with OctoAcme's established practices
- Help new team members quickly onboard to project workflows
- Ensure consistent application of project management principles across teams
- Enable context-aware suggestions for project artifacts and communications

## Project Management Lifecycle

OctoAcme follows a five-phase delivery lifecycle:

### 1. Initiation
Validate business need and authorize work through:
- Problem statement and measurable outcomes
- Stakeholder identification and alignment
- Project one-pager creation
- Initial risk assessment
- Go/no-go decision gate

### 2. Planning
Transform approved initiatives into actionable plans:
- Break work into shippable increments
- Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
- Estimate scope and define Definition of Done
- Identify dependencies and integration points
- Create release plan and milestone map

### 3. Execution & Tracking
Manage day-to-day delivery with consistent rhythm:
- Daily standups (15 min) focusing on progress and blockers
- Weekly delivery syncs for updates and risk flags
- Sprint/milestone demos and reviews
- Continuous quality assurance and testing
- Track velocity and burndown metrics

### 4. Release & Deployment
Standardized release process to reduce risk:
- Pre-release validation (CI, security scans, acceptance criteria)
- Deployment to staging with smoke tests
- Production deployment with verification
- Release notes and stakeholder announcements
- Rollback plans and incident response procedures

### 5. Close & Retrospective
Capture learnings and drive improvements:
- Retrospectives after sprints, releases, or milestones
- Document what went well and improvement areas
- Create 2-3 prioritized action items with owners
- Track and measure improvement impact
- Celebrate successes and iterate

## Core Principles

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless problem-solving

## Key Roles & Responsibilities

### Project Manager (PM)
Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications. Facilitates meetings, maintains project documentation, and ensures transparency across stakeholders.

### Product Manager (PdM)
Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success. Owns product vision and validates solutions through user research and metrics.

### Developers
Implement features, write tests and documentation, participate in code reviews, and help identify technical risks.

### QA/Testing
Validate quality standards and acceptance criteria through various testing approaches.

### Stakeholders
Provide inputs, approvals, and business context for decision-making.

## Communication Cadence

OctoAcme maintains predictable communication rhythms:

- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute team syncs on progress and blockers (twice weekly minimum, or as agreed)
- **Weekly PM + PdM Sync**: Alignment on priorities, risks, and decisions
- **Weekly Delivery Sync**: Team progress updates and risk flagging
- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates**: Broader status reports to leadership and partners
- **Ad-hoc Escalations**: As needed for critical issues or blockers

## Key Artifacts

Projects maintain the following core documentation:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem, goal, success metrics, stakeholders
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline, milestones, and dependencies
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Definition of Done**: Quality standards and completion criteria
- **Risk Register**: Tracked risks with impact, likelihood, owner, and mitigation
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items from team reflections
